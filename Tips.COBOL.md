# COBOL Tips and Resources

- This tips file is more of a curiosity - but in case it is of interest to others...
- My first professional programming job (1986) - involved some COBOL programming - as well as the obscure IBM programming
  language Event Driven Language (EDL) on the IBM Series/1.

- COBOL was created in 1959 by the CODASYL Committee (With Rear Admiral Grace Hopper as a technical consultant to the committee), its design follows Grace Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that is close to English. It prioritizes readability, reliability, and long-term maintenance. The language has been implemented throughout the decades on many platforms with many dialects.
