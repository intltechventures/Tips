Preventing Auto-Play of Media
* https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes
  * "You can also decide to make sure playback autoplay is never allowed by disabling use of MEI, applying autoplay policy to Web Audio, and whether sites with the highest overall MEI get playback autoplay by default for new users. This can be done with three internal switches with chrome.exe --disable-features=PreloadMediaEngagementData,AutoplayIgnoreWebAudio, MediaEngagementBypassAutoplayPolicies."
