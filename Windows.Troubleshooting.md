2. Select ‘Create standard settings’ and click Next.
3. Select ‘Automatically select unsigned drivers’ and click Next.
4. Update any or all drivers in the list.
5. If you have just upgraded to Windows 10, also try ‘Automatically select drivers built for older versions of Windows’ and click Next. Update those too if they don’t overlap with step 4.
